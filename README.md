# VibeRo - Vibrotactile Stiffness Perception Interface for Virtual Reality

[Link] to the publication.

This is a vibrotactile hand-held device to achieve haptic cues of different soft objects. The proposed method is based on combining the vision-driven displacement produced by the pseudo-haptics effect (Virtual Environment projected through head-mounted display (HMD)) with the haptic illusion of a limb displacement obtained from force-driven synthesis of vibration of a contact surface. 

VibeRo features a voice-coil actuator and force-sensitive resistors for generating squeeze forces at fingertips.
