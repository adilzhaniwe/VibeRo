# VibeRo - Vibrotactile Stiffness Perception Interface for Virtual Reality

This research project was presented in ICRA2020 conference and published in Robotics and Automation Letters journal. [The link] to the publication.

VibeRo is a vibrotactile hand-held device to achieve haptic cues of different soft objects. The proposed method is based on combining the vision-driven displacement produced by the pseudo-haptics effect (Virtual Environment projected through head-mounted display (HMD)) with the haptic illusion of a limb displacement obtained from force-driven synthesis of vibration of a contact surface. VibeRo features a voice-coil actuator and force-sensitive resistors for generating squeeze forces at fingertips.
